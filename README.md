This project allows the user to compare two stocks over the span of 2010 - 2022 in order to help predict and make decisions about which stock to invest in next. 
Libraries such as Pandas, plotly, yFinance and requests are used in order to create the visualizations and compare the stocks, and streamlit is used to push this
data onto a simple web display. Data is taken from the IBM data source provided in the Python Project for Data Science course. Follow the comments within the 
.ipynb file to import which stocks ou would like to compare, and then run the .py file to produce the graphs in a web display.
